<p>Looking at <em>Submerged</em> on Steam, I thought, This is amazing!
I wasn't far wrong.</p>
<p>You are Miku, on a quest to find supplies to treat your injured brother.
Strange, once-human creatures watch from afar, coming closer each time you bring something back to base.</p>

<h1>Gameplay</h1>
<p>Boating and climbing are Submerged's main activities, neither of which is very difficult. Boating 
has an odd lack of momentum- you stop immediately on releasing the keys. Was this intentional, or just
the product of lazy developers?</p>
<p>The game's store page boasts "increasingly difficult navigation puzzles". Translation: some buildings are bigger and have
more possible routes to the item. There are no environmental factors to impede your progress- not so much as a fatigue mechanic.</p>

<h2>Stories</h2>
<p>There's no dialog in <em>Sumberged</em>. Instead the game's plot
is doled out in simple pictographs. Pretentious? Perhaps. But it's fairly obvious that a disaster drowned the city.
